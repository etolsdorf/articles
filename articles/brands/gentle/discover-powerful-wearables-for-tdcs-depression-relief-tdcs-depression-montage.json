    {
      "q": "What is the montage for tDCS for depression?",
      "a": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) for depression typically involves applying a low electrical current to specific brain regions, often targeting the prefrontal cortex. Research suggests that this method may help enhance mood and cognitive function, offering a non-invasive option for those seeking alternative treatments."
    },
    {
      "q": "How effective is tDCS for depression?",
      "a": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown promise in reducing depressive symptoms in some studies, with effects varying among individuals. While it may support mood improvement, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and optimal use in depression treatment."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the benefits of tDCS therapy?",
      "a": "tDCS therapy may enhance cognitive function, improve mood, and support mental health by modulating neuronal activity. Research indicates it can be beneficial for conditions like depression and anxiety, offering a non-invasive option for those seeking alternative therapeutic approaches."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is tDCS not FDA approved?",
      "a": "tDCS, or transcranial direct current stimulation, is not FDA approved due to limited large-scale clinical trials demonstrating its safety and efficacy for specific conditions. Ongoing research aims to clarify its potential benefits, but regulatory approval requires more robust evidence."
