  "B1": "Your immune system plays a vital role in maintaining your overall wellness, acting as a defense mechanism against pathogens. One way to support your immune system is through the intake of immune vitamins. These are essential nutrients that contribute to the proper functioning of your immune response. Immune vitamins, such as vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin E, are known to help maintain the body's defenses. They work by supporting the production and activity of immune cells, which are crucial in identifying and neutralizing harmful invaders.\n\nIncorporating immune vitamins into your daily routine can be beneficial. They can be consumed through a proper diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, or through supplements when dietary intake is insufficient. By including these vitamins, you provide your body with the necessary tools to maintain a balanced immune response, which is especially important during times of stress or seasonal changes.",

  "B2": "Inflammation is a natural response of your body to injury or infection, but chronic inflammation can lead to various health issues. This is where inflammatory supplements come into play. These supplements are designed to help your body manage inflammation effectively. They typically include ingredients like omega-3 fatty acids, turmeric, and ginger, which are known for their anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nBy incorporating inflammatory supplements into your wellness regimen, you can support your body's ability to regulate inflammation.
